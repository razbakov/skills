# Viral Threads

Transform any content into engaging social media threads that people actually want to repost.

## Golden Rule

**Write like a person with an opinion, not a newsletter summarizing bullet points.**

Every tweet should have one emotional beat — not a list of facts. If it reads like a press release or a LinkedIn post, rewrite it.

## Thread Structure

1. **Hook** (Tweet 1) — Stop the scroll, create information gap
2. **Body** (Tweets 2-6) — One emotional beat per tweet, conversational
3. **Twist/Stakes** (Tweet 6-7) — The "but here's the scary part" or "here's the real signal"
4. **CTA** (Final tweet) — Give readers a reason to repost (status, identity, urgency)

## The 3-Sentence Hook Formula

```
[Concrete scene or specific detail — not "I've been doing X for Y years"]

[Twist that makes the scene ironic, tragic, or absurd]

[Promise: why the reader should care]
```

**Good:**
```
Someone mass-produced a $200 "Prompt Engineering" course last week.

Today OpenAI and Anthropic both shipped models that work better when you DON'T tell them what to do.

That course aged like milk in 7 days. Here's why:
```

**Bad (boring, generic):**
```
I've been tracking AI model releases obsessively for 3 years.

Today, both OpenAI and Anthropic released models that make prompt engineering obsolete.

Here's what just happened (and what it means for every developer):
```

The difference: the good hook tells a *story* with a victim. The bad hook announces a *topic*.

## Tone Rules

- **Conversational, not informational.** Write like you're texting a smart friend, not presenting at a conference.
- **Opinionated.** Take a side. "Brutal." "We are not talking about this enough." "Useless."
- **Short sentences hit harder.** One-word sentences are fine. Fragment sentences too.
- **Use "you" to make it personal.** "Your 47-step system prompt? Useless." beats "System prompts are becoming less relevant."
- **Schadenfreude works.** People love watching old paradigms die. Let them enjoy it.
- **No corporate filler.** Kill phrases like "key takeaways", "in this thread", "let's dive in", "here are 5 things".

## Body Tweet Rules

- One emotional beat per tweet, not a bullet-point summary
- Lead with the most visceral detail, then explain
- Use → bullets sparingly, only for hard data
- Include specific numbers but embed them in story ($285B, -18%, 7 days)
- If a tweet could appear in a newsletter, it's too flat — add voice

## What Makes People Repost

People repost when sharing makes them look:
- **Smart** — "I knew about this before everyone else"
- **Ahead** — "I see where things are going"
- **Contrarian** — "I don't follow the herd"

Your CTA should activate one of these. Not "if this was useful, repost" but "Most of your timeline is still debating X. They need to see this."

## 7 Psychological Triggers

Use at least 2-3 in your hook:

| Trigger | How to Apply |
|---------|--------------|
| Pattern interrupt | Counterintuitive claim |
| Curiosity gap | Promise reveal later |
| FOMO | "Most people don't know..." |
| Social proof | Numbers, results, credentials |
| Emotional arousal | Strong feeling words |
| Surprise | Unexpected twist |
| Personal relevance | "You" language, specific audience |

## Content Formats That Work

1. **Contrarian take** — Challenge conventional wisdom (strongest for virality)
2. **"Someone just lost"** — Show who/what became obsolete and why
3. **Curated knowledge** — Summarize research, books, experts
4. **Personal journey** — "How I went from X to Y"
5. **Tutorial** — Step-by-step breakdown with quick wins

## Anti-Patterns (things that make threads boring)

- Starting with "I've been doing X for Y years" (generic authority claim)
- Bullet-point listicles disguised as tweets ("5 shifts you need to know")
- Summary tweets that just restate what was already said
- "Here's what I learned" without emotional stakes
- Neutral, balanced tone with no opinion
- Generic CTAs ("follow for more", "if this was useful")

## Workflow

1. **Read the source content** — Identify 3-5 key insights
2. **Find the victim** — Who/what just became obsolete, wrong, or irrelevant?
3. **Write the hook** — Concrete scene + twist + promise (NOT a topic announcement)
4. **Draft body tweets** — One emotional beat per tweet, conversational voice
5. **Add the stakes tweet** — "But here's the scary part" / the real-world consequence
6. **Write CTA** — Give a status-based reason to repost
7. **Kill check** — Read each tweet and ask: "Would I scroll past this?" If yes, rewrite it.
