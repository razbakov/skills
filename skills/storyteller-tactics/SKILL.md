## Quick Start

1. **Identify the situation** — What does the user need? (sell, motivate, convince, connect, explain, lead, impress)
2. **Pick a recipe** — Use the Recipe Matrix below to find a combination of tactics
3. **Apply tactics** — Follow the tactic's key questions to shape the story
4. **Structure it** — Choose a story arc (Man in a Hole, Rags to Riches, No Easy Way, etc.)

## Story Building System

Guide the user through these questions in order:

1. **Why** do you need a story? → use **Concept** tactics
2. **Where** to find your story? → use **Explore** tactics
3. **Your role** in the story? → use **Character** tactics
4. **What** your story needs to do? → use **Function** tactics
5. **How to plan** your story? → use **Structure** tactics
6. **How to tell** your story? → use **Style** tactics
7. **How to share** your story? → use **Organise** tactics

## Concept Tactics

### Dragon & the City
Get people excited. Frame your project as an epic adventure.
- **City** = status quo (safe but limited). What's good? What's wrong? Who's in charge?
- **Dragon** = threat/opportunity. Where's the threat? Is there hidden gold?
- Three options: **Escape** (find safer place), **Defend** (strengthen walls), **Attack** (face the dragon)

### Three Great Conflicts
Raise stakes by identifying which conflict drives the story:
- **Hero vs Nature** — disease, weather, accidents (Jaws)
- **Hero vs Society** — fighting others over resources/values (Black Panther)
- **Hero vs Self** — struggling to do what's right (Trainspotting)
- Find your Dream vs Nightmare, locate the greatest conflict, show how it resolves

### Order & Chaos
Clarify your mission: impose order on chaos, or disrupt a rigid system.
- **Known world** (orderly, safe, restricted) vs **Unknown world** (chaotic, risky, full of potential)
- How does Chaos disrupt Order? You are the Hero — how do you respond?

### Secrets & Puzzles
Get attention with information gaps:
- **Secrets**: new info you discovered, how it was hidden, what audience gains
- **Puzzles**: anomalies, ironies, inconsistencies that demand explanation
- Keywords: secret, hidden, insider, mystery, paradox, bizarre, unexpected

### Rules, Cheats & Rebels
Tell a rule, show someone breaking it — will they be punished or vindicated?
- **Rebels** act selflessly, break rules for a higher purpose, don't hide (Rosa Parks)
- **Cheats** act selfishly, break rules others follow, hide actions (vindication vs punishment)

### Good & Evil
Tap into moral conflicts (Jonathan Haidt's six):
- Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Liberty/Oppression, Authority/Subversion, Loyalty/Betrayal, Purity/Filth
- Simple: pick a side. Complex: two rights collide or lesser of two evils

### Universal Stories
Build on traits everyone recognises:
- Free Will, Conflict & Cooperation, Inconsistencies, Fear & Bravery, Right & Wrong, Rites of Passage

### Curious Tales
Explain what drives you through:
- **Curiosity** (anomaly + potential benefit), **Caution** (anomaly + threat)
- **Flow** (absorption in task), **Envy** (wanting what another does), **Sacrifice** (giving up something valuable)

### Circle of Life
Relatable character archetypes at life stages:
- **Child** (innocent/naive), **Adult** (adventurous/rebellious), **Parent** (wise/dominant)
- Focus on: Conflict between stages, Change/rites of passage, Character fitting or fighting the cycle

### Shock of the Old
Find inspiration in stories from the past. Watch how people relate to old objects:
- Obvious vs hidden purposes, ownership, feelings, symbolic power, connection to deep nature

## Explore Tactics

### Story Listening
Gather wisdom by listening (Gary Klein method):
1. Is this memorable? Why does it stick? What's the emotion?
2. Basic timeline: what were you trying to achieve? What happened?
3. Add key decisions: what were your options? What if you'd tried something else?
4. Identify expertise: where might a novice have failed?

### Emotional Dashboard
Find strong emotions as story seeds:
- Positive: happiness, confidence, love, delight, trust, pride, excitement, joy, conviction
- Negative: sadness, fear, doubt, disgust, distrust, shame, boredom, anger, hate
- Template: "I felt [emotion] when I realised [change] because I wanted [goal] and so I [reaction]"

### Data Detectives
Turn data into stories using three methods:
- **Data Zoomer**: zoom out (big trend) → zoom in (vivid example)
- **Data Detective**: body on floor → search for evidence → vital clue → identify the killer
- **Data Sceptic**: how might we be wrong? Alternative conclusions? What can't be measured?

### Thoughtful Failures
Extract wisdom from mistakes (Google's method):
- What went wrong? (focus on decisions, not blame)
- Check: Goals, Assumptions, Insights, Skills, Communication
- "What could we do differently?" → "Who else needs to hear this?"

### That's Funny
Find "that's funny..." moments:
- **Funny ha-ha**: what made you laugh? How did your mental model change?
- **Funny peculiar**: contradictions, coincidences, unexpected connections
- **Acting funny**: someone out of character — what does it reveal?

### Abstractions
Observe users in action (don't just ask questions):
- Levels: Action → Imitation → Ritual/Play → Narrative → Rationalisation
- Look for contradictions between what people say and do

### Social Proof
Establish credibility through:
- **Trends**: data showing many people acting a certain way
- **Prototypes**: tests/trials and people's reactions
- **Testimonials**: "What would you say to persuade a friend to work with us?"

## Character Tactics

### Trust Me, I'm an Expert
Win trust by showing character and values in action:
- What matters more than money? What projects would you refuse?
- When have you done the right thing at personal cost?
- What values do you share with your audience?

### What's My Motivation?
Figure people out using Method Acting (Stanislavski):
- Who am I? Where am I? When is it? What do I want? Why? How? What must I overcome?
- Map cooperation and conflict between actors

### Drive Stories
Explore inner motivation through:
- **Autonomy**: control over how you work
- **Mastery**: skills steadily improving
- **Purpose**: worthwhile work serving a greater good
- Get positive and negative examples for each

### Hero & Guide
Make the user the Hero; you play the Expert Guide:
- Map the user's journey: where now? → problem → where they want to be
- Guide types: Explorer, Rebel, Sage, Defender, Muse, Warrior

### What's it About?
Escape the curse of knowledge — answer "what are you working on?":
- **Change**: responding to threat or initiating opportunity
- **New information**: you realised something new or spotted something wrong
- **Personal benefit**: "I'm helping [X] achieve [Y]"

### Cut to the Chase
Emergency escape when losing the audience:
- **Cut to action**: "What happened was..." / "Suddenly..."
- **Cut to emotion**: "I was amazed/shocked/disappointed..."
- **Cut to meaning**: "That's when I realised..."
- Or: stop talking, ask the audience a question

---

## Function Tactics

### Pitch Perfect
Sell your idea with structure:
- **Elevator pitch**: Problem → Solution → Why trust me?
- **POPP arc**: Problem (negative) → Opportunity (positive) → Practical Steps (negative) → Promise (positive)

### Simple Sales Stories
Three approaches:
- "Someone **like you** buys this" — relatable customer
- "Someone **you like** buys this" — influential endorser
- **Old, Regular, Tricky** customers — loyalty and service stories

### Story-ish Conversations
Make conversations more story-ish by asking:
- "What might it look like in action?" (vivid moments)
- "Where were you? Who was there?" (specifics)
- "What's the strongest feeling?" (emotion)
- "Who did you need to win over?" (conflict)
- "What forced you to change?" (change)

### Innovation Curve
Adapt story to audience risk tolerance:
- **Pioneers**: stories about process and breakthroughs
- **Early Mainstream**: tested in niche, proven results
- **Late Mainstream**: ready for mass market
- **Traditional**: everyone's doing it, we made it easy

## Structure Tactics (Story Arcs)

### Man in a Hole
5 beats: Comfort Zone → Trigger → Crisis (find treasure in the dark) → Recovery → Better Place
*"Nobody ever lost money telling the story of a man in a hole." — Kurt Vonnegut*

### Rags to Riches
3 beats: Hidden Value (hero in bad place but has inner worth) → Trigger & Struggle (outside help, then on their own) → Deserved Recognition

### No Easy Way
6 beats: Problem → Early Success → Setback → Crisis → Recovery → Better Place
*The ultimate rollercoaster. Use when "too good to be true" won't fly.*

### Pride & Fall
5 beats: Bad Place → Pride (defy limits) → Warning → Fall (ignore advice) → Worse Place
*Use to get ahead of scepticism and address it honestly.*

### Downfall
3 beats: Flawed Power (hidden selfish flaw) → Desperate Denial → Deserved Disgrace
*Defend against your own downfall, or exploit a rival's.*

### Epic Fail
6 failure narratives: Catharsis, Hubris, Betrayal, Mechanistic, Zeitgeist, Nemesis
*Pick the honest frame for what went wrong.*

### Voyage & Return
Home (safe/dull) → Voyage (strange new world, dangers, opportunities) → Return (changed, making home better)

### Happy Ever Afters
Hero changes by: **Growing Up**, **Finding Home/Love/Respect**, or **Doing the Right Thing**

### Five Ts
Quick story shaping:
- **Timeline**: beginning, middle, end ("At first... Then... Now...")
- **Turning Points**: "Everything changed when..."
- **Tensions**: start with maximum conflict
- **Temptations**: easy way out vs right thing
- **Teachable Moments**: "What this taught me is..."

---

## Style Tactics

### Movie Time
Make us "see" the story: Action (where, what's happening, what next?) → Emotion (who, stakes, feelings) → Meaning (what changed, why it matters)
*Movie-check: "What's the movie playing in their heads now?"*

### Story Hooks
Two types:
- **Unexpected**: when everyone zigs, you zag. "Why you'll fail" instead of "How to succeed"
- **Knowledge**: rules, explainers, listicles, life-hacks, secrets (expertise + insider status)

### Three is the Magic Number
- **Attention Three**: repeat core message 3 times
- **Reversal Three**: setup, setup, reversal (Little Pigs)
- **Moderate Three**: extreme, extreme, just right (Goldilocks)

### Rolls Royce Moment
Find one vivid, exemplary, relatable detail that tells everything:
*"At 60mph, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock."*

### Leave it Out!
Create mystery by omitting what's expected. Let audience fill gaps.
*Hemingway's 6-word story: "For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn."*

### Show & Tell
Washing line method: show image → tell what it is → tell what we can't see → new image → refer immediately

## Organise Tactics

### Story Bank
Track stories with: What's the story? Why tell it? Who finds it useful? Who heard it? Whose story? Still current?

### Big, Small, Inside, Outside
- **Small Inside**: team habits, appraisals, culture
- **Small Outside**: blog/social, brand values
- **Big Inside**: induction, awards
- **Big Outside**: pitch, recruitment, conference

### Audience Profile
Know your audience before choosing tactics:
- Basic info, problems, hopes, fears, what they already say about your idea
- Who should tell the story? (customer > you)
- Get permission to share others' stories

---

## Application Workflow

When a user asks for storytelling help:

1. **Clarify the goal**: What's the situation? (sell, motivate, convince, connect, explain, lead, impress, or specific content format)
2. **Identify the audience**: Who will hear this? What do they care about?
3. **Select tactics**: Use the Recipe Matrix or Story Building System
4. **Draft the story**: Apply selected tactics' key questions to the user's material
5. **Choose a structure**: Pick a story arc that fits (Man in a Hole for lessons, No Easy Way for realism, Rags to Riches for optimism, etc.)
6. **Add style**: Movie Time for vivid scenes, Story Hooks for attention, Three is Magic Number for memorability
7. **Review**: Does it have conflict? Emotion? Change? A teachable moment?
